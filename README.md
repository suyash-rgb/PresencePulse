# Understanding ngrok and ngrok Tunnels

## What is ngrok?
ngrok is a powerful tool that allows you to create secure tunnels to your local server, making it accessible from the internet. It is particularly useful for testing webhooks, APIs, and local development projects without needing to deploy them to a remote server.

## What is an ngrok Tunnel?
An ngrok tunnel is a secure, encrypted connection created by ngrok that allows external access to a locally hosted server. When you run ngrok, it assigns a public URL to your local server, enabling anyone with the URL to access your local application. This is extremely useful for:

- **Development and Testing**: Quickly sharing your local development environment with collaborators or clients.
- **API Integration**: Testing webhooks and API integrations that require public URL callbacks.
- **IoT and Device Management**: Connecting IoT devices running in external networks.
